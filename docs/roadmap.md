# Roadmap

Work is split into two tracks that only meet at named points:

- **S — Simulation.** Headless, deterministic, verified by tests and a text event log.
- **P — Presentation.** Pygame scenes, UI and pixel art. Reads simulation state, never owns it.

A simulation milestone is finished without any art. A presentation milestone only starts once the
simulation milestone it depends on is finished. Every milestone has a "done when" check.

Standing rule for every milestone: new state is added to the save format with a backwards-compatible
default, and new behaviour gets a deterministic test.

## Simulation track

### S0 — Foundations — done
- Simulation clock owned by the simulation (game time), fixed tick, pause and speed
- Explicit command path from scenes into the simulation
- Built-in data (`data/*.json`) loaded through registries
- Headless runner that simulates N days and prints the event log
- Versioned save and load round trip

Done when: the same seed produces the same log twice, and a saved world reloads to an equal state.

### S1 — Alive in the settlement — done
- Tile map, rooms and interactables (bed, pantry, campfire)
- Grid pathfinding and movement
- Needs satisfied by using interactables and items
- Utility AI choosing between scored candidate actions

Done when: 3 residents run 7 days headless and no need stays pinned at its maximum.

### S2 — Social loop — done
- Conversations and arguments as actions between residents who are near each other
- Directional relationship changes
- Memories created from what a resident took part in
- Domain events with participants, location and importance

Done when: a week of simulation leaves relationships measurably different from the starting state,
and A -> B has diverged from B -> A for at least one pair.

### S3 — Local knowledge — done
- Witnesses derived from presence and line of sight
- Per-resident knowledge of events
- Rumors with credibility, passed on in conversation

Done when: a resident who was absent does not react to an event until someone tells them.

### S4 — Intervention — done
- Importance bands select intervention candidates
- Decisions generated from events, with options as influence modifiers
- Advice changes utility scores, not outcomes
- Resolution, consequences and settlement history

Done when: one argument runs end to end, and the same advice produces different outcomes for
residents with different personalities.

### S5 — Things matter — done
- Item instances, ownership and containers
- Gifts, trade and theft
- Custom content validation, placeholders for missing content

Done when: a discovered theft changes the victim's relationship with the thief, and a save that
references removed custom content still loads.

### S6 — Work — done
- Jobs as data: a post, shifts, and what working it does
- Residents go to their post for their shift and stay there, unless their body needs something
- Posts that only function while staffed: the cantina serves when someone is behind the bar
- Production: the garden grows the food, the kitchen cooks it
- A guard on duty sees further

Done when: a week passes in which everyone works their shifts, the settlement is fed only by what
its residents grow and cook, and the bar is used only while it is staffed.

### S7 — Consequences — done
- Health and injuries that mend with time, rest and care
- A clinic and a medic's post
- Fights, always preceded by a decision the player can step into
- Weapons as items
- Death, graves and the record of the dead

Done when: a fight never starts without a chance to intervene, the injured recover faster under
the medic's care, and a death removes a resident and everything that depended on them without
breaking the settlement.

Still open here: nobody picks up a weapon on purpose, and a vacant post stays vacant (see S8).

### S8 — A working economy
- Carrying: produce is hauled from where it is made to where it is used, instead of appearing there
- A workshop job: repairs, and items that wear out
- Trade at a post: a shopkeeper, prices, things bought with work
- Residents can change jobs; the player can suggest who does what
- Days off, and what happens when a post is left empty too long

### S9 — Deep relationships
- Friendship tiers
- Adult romance
- Consensual adult sexual relationships as narrative events
- Breakups
- Jealousy and secrets

## Presentation track

### P0 — Style contract (no dependency) — done
- Internal resolution and integer scaling
- Tile size, sprite sizes and sheet layout
- Shared palette
- Asset naming and folder layout
- Asset loader with a placeholder for anything missing

Done when: the rules are written in `docs/visual-style.md` and a missing PNG renders a placeholder
instead of crashing.

### P1 — The settlement (needs S1) — done
- Ground, floor, wall, fence and furniture tiles
- Resident body sprites with idle and walk
- Global view drawn from the real map and resident positions

### P2 — HUD (needs S2) — done
- Bitmap font
- Clock and speed controls
- Resident card showing needs and current action
- `!` marker driven by real events
- Event log panel

### P3 — Faces and interaction (needs S4) — done
- Modular faces: base, eyes, brows, mouth and hair, combined into expressions
- Optional custom PNG faces with a single-image fallback
- Interaction view with dialogue box and selectable options

### P4 — Objects and feedback (needs S5) — done
- Item and food icons
- Small presentation-only animations
- Sound effects reacting to domain events

### P5 — A real settlement — done
- A map larger than the screen, with a scrolling view
- Shacks and premises that are walked into: cantina, storehouse, workshop, two houses, garden, gate
- Art for the new places, posts and residents
- A view that zooms: three steps up close, and an overview with the roofs on and a face per resident

### P6 — Atmosphere
- Day and night: light changes, and fires and lamps matter
- Roofs that hide a building until someone looks inside (so far they are on in the overview and
  off at every closer zoom)
- A minimap, and jumping to whoever needs attention
- More wear and scrap: the place should look salvaged

## Later
- Voice/TTS modulation
- Music
- Expeditions beyond the fence: scavenging as a job, and what comes back with it
- World events
- Radio
- SQLite persistence
- Semantic/vector memory if the amount of narrative memory justifies it
